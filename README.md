## About
Please Check out the GitHub project here: [Depth Player](https://github.com/spite/depth-player).
</br>
The Depth Player is a 3D visualization tool that allows users to generate 3D models from a pair of 2D images: a reference image and a depth map. The depth map provides information on how far or near different parts of the scene are, with white representing areas closer to the viewer and black representing areas farther away. Using this depth data, the Depth Player creates a 3D model, giving a sense of depth and spatial arrangement.

Built using three.js, a popular JavaScript library for 3D graphics, the tool enables users to interact with the generated models directly in the browser, allowing for rotation and zooming to explore the scene from various perspectives.

This version of the Depth Player has been adapted and modified from its original iteration to enhance functionality and offer improved support for depth-based visualization.

## Instructions

1. Upload a reference image and a depth image (where white represents near and black represents far).
2. Click the `Create model` button to visualize the model in 3D.
3. Use the following controls:
   - **Click and drag** to rotate the model.
   - **Mousewheel** to zoom in/out.
   - **Touch and drag** to rotate (for touch devices).
   - **Pinch** to zoom (for touch devices).

Enjoy exploring 3D depth!
